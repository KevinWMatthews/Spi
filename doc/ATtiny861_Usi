USIDR – USI Data Register (Serial Register)
  This is an 8-bit serial in, serial out shift register
  DO is connected to bit 7
  DI is connected to bit 0
  As data is sent/shifted out from bit 7 along MOSI, data is sent/shifted into bit 0 from MISO.



USIBR – USI Buffer Register
  After a transfer is completed, the contents of the USIDR are copied here.
  This allows you to read the input data while processing the next transmission.



USISR – USI Status Register
• Bit 7 – USISIF: Start Condition Interrupt Flag
  In some conditions (look these up), any clock pulse sets this flag.
  Clear only by writing a logical one.
  Will wake up the processor from sleep mode.

• Bit 6 – USIOIF: Counter Overflow Interrupt Flag
  Essentially an end transmission flag.
  This flag is set when the 4-bit counter overflows.
  Clear only by writing a logical one.

• Bit 5 – USIPF: Stop Condition Flag
  Two-wire mode only.

• Bit 4 – USIDC: Data Output Collision
  Two-wire mode only.

• Bits 3:0 – USICNT3:0: Counter Value
  Counts each USI clock edge.
  The counter is incremented by
    the external clock edge detector OR
    a Timer/Counter0 Compare Match OR
    by software using the USICLK or (?) USITC strobe bits.
  There are 8 bits per transmission, or 16 clock edges, hence a 4-bit counter.



USICR – USI Control Register
• Bit 7 – USISIE: Start Condition Interrupt Enable
  Set to enable

• Bit 6 – USIOIE: Counter Overflow Interrupt Enable
  Set to 1 to enable

• Bits 5:4 – USIWM1:0: Wire Mode
  These only affect data and clock outputs (not data and clock inputs).
  00  Port pins operate as normal
  01  Three-wire mode
  10  Two-wire mode
  11  Two-wire mode

• Bits 3:2 – USICS1:0: Clock Source Select
  Set to 00 to disable external clock, allowing a software strobe to be used (use the USICLK bit to do this)
    I'm not really sure what this does... will it set the SCLK pin?
  Set to 10 to enable external clock.
    If you also set the USICLK bit, I don't think that this uses an external oscillator as the clock.
    I think it treats SCLK as the clock line but allows YOU to toggle it.

• Bit 1 – USICLK: Clock Strobe
  When external clock is disabled (using USICS1:0),
  write a logical 1 to:
    shift the USIDR one step
    increment the counter by one

• Bit 0 – USITC: Toggle Clock Port Pin
  Toggles the USCK value
  DD(R?)B2 must be set to toggle the output line



USIPP – USI Pin Position
• Bits 7:1 – Res: Reserved Bits
  Always read 0

• Bit 0 – USIPOS: USI Pin Position
  The USI pins (DO, DI, and SCK) can be placed either on PORTA or PORTB!
  Default to PB2:PB0
  Set to 1 to use PA2:PA0
