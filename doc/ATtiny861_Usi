USIDR – USI Data Register (Serial Register)
  This is an 8-bit serial in, serial out shift register
  DO is connected to bit 7
  DI is connected to bit 0
  Data is sent/shifted out from bit 7 along MOSI and simultaneously received/shifted into bit 0 from MISO.



USIBR – USI Buffer Register
  After a transfer is completed, the contents of the USIDR will be automatically copied here.
  This allows you to read the input data while processing the next transmission.



USISR – USI Status Register
• Bit 7 – USISIF: Start Condition Interrupt Flag
  In some conditions (look these up), any clock pulse sets this flag.
  Clear only by writing a logical one.
  Will wake up the processor from sleep mode.

• Bit 6 – USIOIF: Counter Overflow Interrupt Flag
  Essentially an end transmission flag.
  This flag is set when the 4-bit counter overflows.
  Clear only by writing a logical one.

• Bit 5 – USIPF: Stop Condition Flag
  Two-wire mode only.

• Bit 4 – USIDC: Data Output Collision
  Two-wire mode only.

• Bits 3:0 – USICNT3:0: Counter Value
  Counts each USI clock edge.
  The counter is incremented by
    the external clock edge detector OR
    a Timer/Counter0 Compare Match OR
    by software using the USICLK or (?) USITC strobe bits.
  There are 8 bits per transmission, or 16 clock edges, hence a 4-bit counter.



USICR – USI Control Register
• Bit 7 – USISIE: Start Condition Interrupt Enable
  Set to enable

• Bit 6 – USIOIE: Counter Overflow Interrupt Enable
  Set to 1 to enable

• Bits 5:4 – USIWM1:0: Wire Mode
  These only affect data and clock outputs (not data and clock inputs).
  00  Port pins operate as normal
  01  Three-wire mode
  10  Two-wire mode
  11  Two-wire mode

• Bits 3:2 – USICS1:0: Clock Source Select
  Set to 00 to disable external clock, allowing a software strobe to be used (use the USICLK bit to do this)
    You have to set the USITC and USICLK bits accordingly, i.e.
      Set the clock port bit, which toggles the clock port pin.
      Toggle clock port pin as above AND set the strobe clock bit, increments the counter and shift bit
      (Needs verification)

  Set to USICS1 to enable external clock.
    Clear/set USICS0 to select positive/negative edge, respectively (spi mode 0 or 1 [verify])
    Treats SCLK as the clock line but allows YOU to toggle it.
    Bit shift/latch and counter increment are handled automatically each time that you set the USITC bit.

• Bit 1 – USICLK: Clock Strobe
  The function of this pin varies
  When external clock is selected (USICS1 is set to 1),
    set to 1 to enable a software strobe for the clock.

• Bit 0 – USITC: Toggle Clock Port Pin
  The function of this pin varies
  Toggles the USCK value
  DDB2 must be set to toggle the output line (otherwise clocking is only done internally)
  If external clock with software strobe (UCICS 3:2 to 1:0 and USICLK to 1), this automatically:
    increments the clock counter by 1
    shifts the data in the data register (when appropriate)



USIPP – USI Pin Position
• Bits 7:1 – Res: Reserved Bits
  Always read 0

• Bit 0 – USIPOS: USI Pin Position
  The USI pins (DO, DI, and SCK) can be placed either on PORTA or PORTB!
  Default to PB2:PB0
  Set to 1 to use PA2:PA0



For three-wire mode and a software-controlled clock pulse,
  Set USIWM1:0 (USICR 5:4) to 01   three-wire mode
  Set USICS1:0 (USICR 3:2) to 10   external clock
  Set USICLK1  (USICR 1)   to 1    external clock with software strobe
  Set USIOIE   (USICR 6)   to 1    enable counter overflow interrupt
  Set USIPOS   (USIPP 0)   to 0/1  SPI pins on PORTB or PORTA, respectively
  Place output data in USIDR.
  Toggle USITC to toggle the clock. Doing this:
    shifts the data in USIDR
    increments the counter
    toggles the clock (you don't need to toggle USITC)
  Read input data from USIBR.
