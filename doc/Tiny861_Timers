~~~ Timer 0 ~~~
~ TCCR0A – Timer/Counter0 Control Register A ~
• Bit 7 – TCW0: Timer/Counter0 Width
  Set to 0 for 8-bit mode
  Set to 1 for 16-bit mode

• Bit 6 – ICEN0: Input Capture Mode Enable
  Set to 1 to enable input capture mode (?)
  Looks like we can use this for timing external events!

• Bit 5 – ICNC0: Input Capture Noise Canceler
  Set to 1 to filter input on pin ICP0

• Bit 4 – ICES0: Input Capture Edge Select

• Bit 3 - ACIC0: Analog Comparator Input Capture Enable
  Set to 1 to have the analog comparator trigger an input capture event

• Bits 2:1 – Res: Reserved Bits
  Always read 0

• Bit 0 – CTC0: Waveform Generation Mode
  If in 8-bit mode,
    Set to 0 for normal timer mode
    Set to 1 for CTC (Clear Timer on Compare) mode



~ TCCR0B – Timer/Counter0 Control Register B ~
• Bit 4 – TSM: Timer/Counter Synchronization Mode
  Look into this bit when configuring the timer.
  Holds the value in PSR0, enabling you to hold the prescaler reset signal. This allows you to configure the timer without the prescaler advancing.
  ** I think you need to do this! **
  ** Maybe not if we enable the timer last **

• Bit 3 – PSR0: Prescaler Reset Timer/Counter0
  Write 1 to clear the prescaler.
  Cleared by hardware unless the TSM bit (TCCR0B bit 4) is set.
  ** Should we do this after configuration? **
  ** Can't hurt **

• Bits 2:0 – CS02, CS01, CS00: Clock Select0, Bit 2, 1, and 0
  Define the clock source/prescaler for Timer 0



~ TCNT0L – Timer/Counter0 Register Low Byte ~
  The timer counter register.
  You have both read and write access.

~ TCNT0H – Timer/Counter0 Register High Byte ~
  The high byte when the timer is in 16-bit mode.
  You have both read and write access.



~ OCR0A – Timer/Counter0 Output Compare Register A ~
  This value is continuously compared to the TCNT0 (Timer/Counter) registers.
  A match can generate an Output Compare interrupt.
  In CTC mode this counter is cleared to zero when the counter value (TCNT0) matches the OCR0A.
    The OCR0A defines the top value for the counter.

~ OCR0B – Timer/Counter0 Output Compare Register B ~
  This value is continuously compared to the TCNT0 (Timer/Counter) registers.
  A match can generate an Output Compare interrupt.
  This counter does not seem to be tied to CTC mode.



~ TIMSK – Timer/Counter0 Interrupt Mask Register ~
• Bit 4 – OCIE0A: Timer/Counter0 Output Compare Match A Interrupt Enable
  To enable interrupts when Timer/Counter0 matches OCR0A,
    Set this bit to 1
    Set the I-bit in the Status Register (enable global interrupts)
  This interrupt will set the OCF0A bit in the TIFR0 register.

• Bit 3 – OCIE0B: Timer/Counter Output Compare Match B Interrupt Enable
  To enable interrupts when Timer/Counter0 matches OCR0B,
    Set this bit to 1
    Set the I-bit in the Status Register (enable global interrupts)
  This interrupt will set the OCF0B bit in the TIFR0 register.

• Bit 1 – TOIE0: Timer/Counter0 Overflow Interrupt Enable
  To enable interrupts when Timer/Counter0 overflows,
    Set this bit to 1
    Set the I-bit in the Status Register (enable global interrupts)
  This interrupt will set the TOV0 bit in the TIFR0 register.

• Bit 0 – TICIE0: Timer/Counter0, Input Capture Interrupt Enable
  To enable the Input Capture interrupt when an Input Capture event occurs,
    Set this bit to 1
    Set the I-bit in the Status Register (enable global interrupts)
  This interrupt will set the ICF0 bit in the TIFR register.



~ TIFR – Timer/Counter0 Interrupt Flag Register ~
• Bit 4 – OCF0A: Output Compare Flag 0 A
  This bit is set when OCF0A matches Timer/Counter0.
  Cleared by hardware when the interrupt handler is executed.
  This bit is set in 16-bit mode.

• Bit 3 – OCF0B: Output Compare Flag 0 B
  This bit is set when OCF0B matches Timer/Counter0.
  Cleared by hardware when the interrupt handler is executed.
  This is not set in 16-bit mode.

• Bit 1 – TOV0: Timer/Counter0 Overflow Flag
  This bit is set when Timer/Counter0 overflows.
  Cleared by hardware when the interrupt handler is executed.
  This is not set in 16-bit mode.

• Bit 0 – ICF0: Timer/Counter0, Input Capture Flag
  This flag is set when a capture event occurs on the ICP0 pin.
  Cleared by hardware when the interrupt handler is executed.
