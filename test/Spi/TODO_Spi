TODO_Spi

The Spi Overflow handler interrupt needs to save data. The only way I can think of is to use a global variable. Correct?

Disable interrupts when usi overflow is saving data?


Start transmission needs a data collision flag.

Add reset function? We could clear out the counter, clear the flag, and re-load data to USIDR.
