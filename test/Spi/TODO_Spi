TODO_Spi

Support slave device.

Test sending to multiple slaves

Start transmission needs a data collision flag.
Think about a multi-threaded collision flag.

The Spi Overflow handler interrupt needs to save data. The only way I can think of is to use a global variable. Correct?

Disable interrupts when usi overflow is saving data?

Add reset function? We could clear out the counter, clear the flag, and re-load data to USIDR.

Port demo code for ATtiny861 and compile it to see how its size compares to mine.

Add Slave Destroy

Should interrupt be in HW layer or interface layer?

Should slave select be in HW layer or interface layer?
