TODO_Spi

Start transmission needs a data collision flag.
Think about a multi-threaded collision flag.

The Spi Overflow handler interrupt needs to save data. The only way I can think of is to use a global variable. Correct?

Disable interrupts when usi overflow is saving data?

Add reset function? We could clear out the counter, clear the flag, and re-load data to USIDR.

Port demo code for ATtiny861 and compile it to see how its size compares to mine.
