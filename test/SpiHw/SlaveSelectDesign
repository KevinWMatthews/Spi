Port and Pin, or DDR and PORT

Ex: DDRA, PORTA0

SetupSlaveSelect(whichSlave, DDR, port_ie_pin)
we can
  create a struct
  use fancy macros
  Could use pointers and memory mapping.

We want to:
  pass in the whichSlave to SelectSlave and ReleaseSlave
  SpiHw.c should keep track of everything else.

slave_array[MAX]

SetupSlave(SLAVE1, DDRA, PORTA0)
{
  slave_array[SLAVE1] = PORTA0;
  DDRA = output
}
