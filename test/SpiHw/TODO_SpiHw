TODO_SpiHw

Clean up active slave. Do we want to move the struct to the HW level?
It might make Spi testing easier, too.

Set up Slave Select
  Hard-code these for now:
    SpiHw_SetupSlaveSelect1()
    SpiHw_SetupSlaveSelect2()
  Each function will:
    Set DDRA/B
    Clear PORTA/B
  Those settings will be hard-coded to provide maximum flexibility to the end user, i.e. they can switch pins with ease.
  We could use a macro, too.

  Will want to refactor to remove duplication.

Look into what states the lines are left in after a transmission is finished.

Look into if we can use MISO, MOSI, etc directly.

Should the interrupt handler be moved to SpiHw?

Fix Configure Usi Pins
  Needs to configure the ddr properly for either style.
