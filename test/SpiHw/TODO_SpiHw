TODO_SpiHw

Pull-up resistors?

Clean up active slave. Do we want to move the struct to the HW level?
It might make Spi testing easier, too.

Look into what states the lines are left in after a transmission is finished.

Look into if we can use MISO, MOSI, etc directly.

Should the interrupt handler be moved to SpiHw?

Want to move SetPinAsInput/Output() to somewhere more general.
